# <u>"**Practical MLOps**" Book, by Noah Gift and Alfredo Deza:</u>
# Book Exercises, Tests and Practice solved by Enric Domingo while reading the book

## 1. Introduction to MLOps

- Rise of the Machine Learning Engineer and MLOps
- What is MLOps?
- DevOps and MLOps
- An MLOps Hierarchy of Needs

### **Exercises:**

- [x] Create a new GitHub repository with necessary **Python** scaffolding using **Makefile**, linting, and testing. Then, perform additional steps such as code formatting in your Makefile.

- [x] Using **GitHub Actions**, test a GitHub project with two or more Python versions.

- [ ] Using a **cloud native** build server (AWS Code Build, GCP Cloud Build, or Azure DevOps Pipelines), perform **continuous integrations** for your project.

- [ ] Containerize a GitHub project by integrating a **Dockerfile** and automatically registering new conainers to a **Container Registry**.

- [ ] Create a simple **load test** for your application using a load test framework such as [locust](https://locust.io) or [loader](https://loader.io) and automatically run this test when you push changes to a staging branch.

### **Exercises:** 

- [ ] Run a hello world Python GitHub project and check it our and run your tests on all three clouds: AWS, Azure, and GCP.  

- [ ] Make a new Flask application that serves out a "hello world" type route using AWS Elastic Beanstalk you thinb other people would find helpful and put the code into a GitHub repo along with a screenshot of it serving our ta request in the GitHub README.md. Then, create a continuous delivery process to deploy the Flask application using AWS CodeBuild.
  
- [ ] Fork this [repository](https://oreil.ly/IItEr) that contains a Flask ML app and deploy it with CD on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk and Code Pipeline

- [ ] Fork this [repository](https://oreil.ly/JSsEQ) that contains a Flask ML app and deploy it with CD on GCP using Google App Engine and Cloud Build or Cloud Run and Cloud Build.

- [ ] Fork this [repository](https://oreil.ly/F2uBk) that contains a Flask ML app and deploy it with CD on Azure using Azure App Services and Azure DevOps Pipelines.

- [ ] Use the Traveling Salesman code example and port it to work with coordinates you grab from an API, say all of the best restaurants in a city you want to visit. You will never think about vacation the same again.

- [ ] Using the [TensorFlow Playground](https://oreil.ly/ojebX), experiment with changing the hyperparams across different datasets as well as problem types. Can you identify optimal configs of hidden layers, lr, and regularization rate for different datasets?
