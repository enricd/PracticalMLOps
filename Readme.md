# <u>"**Practical MLOps**" Book, by Noah Gift and Alfredo Deza:</u>
# Book Exercises, Tests and Practice solved by Enric Domingo while reading the book

## 1. Introduction to MLOps
- Rise of the Machine Learning Engineer and MLOps
- What is MLOps?
- DevOps and MLOps
- An MLOps Hierarchy of Needs

### **Exercises:**
- [x] Create a new GitHub repository with necessary **Python** scaffolding using **Makefile**, linting, and testing. Then, perform additional steps such as code formatting in your Makefile.
- [x] Using **GitHub Actions**, test a GitHub project with two or more Python versions.
- [ ] Using a **cloud native** build server (AWS Code Build, GCP Cloud Build, or Azure DevOps Pipelines), perform **continuous integrations** for your project.
- [ ] Containerize a GitHub project by integrating a **Dockerfile** and automatically registering new conainers to a **Container Registry**.
- [ ] Create a simple **load test** for your application using a load test framework such as [locust](https://locust.io) or [loader](https://loader.io) and automatically run this test when you push changes to a staging branch.
